# HER2-Genome-Alignment
This repository contains a Python script that performs genome alignment using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. The script reads a genome sequence from a file, preprocesses the data, and then aligns two sequences using the Smith-Waterman algorithm.

## Introduction
The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a local sequence alignment algorithm that is used to find the best local alignment between two sequences. This repository contains a Python implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm that can be used to align genome sequences.

## Features
1. Reads genome sequence from a file
2. Preprocesses the data to remove non-ATCG characters
3. Aligns two sequences using the Smith-Waterman algorithm
4. Returns the maximum score and the aligned sequences

## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. No external dependencies required

## Installation
To use this repository, simply clone it and run the script using Python.
