# HER2-Genome-Alignment
This repository contains a Python script that performs genome alignment using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. The script reads a genome sequence from a file, preprocesses the data, and then aligns two sequences using the Smith-Waterman algorithm.

## Introduction
The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a local sequence alignment algorithm that is used to find the best local alignment between two sequences. This repository contains a Python implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm that can be used to align genome sequences.

## Features
1. Reads genome sequence from a file
2. Preprocesses the data to remove non-ATCG characters
3. Aligns two sequences using the Smith-Waterman algorithm
4. Returns the maximum score and the aligned sequences

## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. No external dependencies required

## Installation
To use this repository, simply clone it and run the script using Python.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HER2-Genome-Alignment.git
cd HER2-Genome-Alignment
python app.py
```

## Usage
The script reads a genome sequence from a file named `gene.fna` in the same directory. The file should contain the genome sequence in `FASTA` format.

To use the script, simply run it using Python. The script will preprocess the data, align the sequences, and print the maximum score and the aligned sequences.

## Example Output
The script will output the maximum score and the aligned sequences. For example:

```
Smith-Waterman Alignment:
Score: 91
Alignment 1: C--TG--A-T-AAA-G-TC---AAAA-AAT-AA-CG---G-TT-TC-AGTT---AA-CAA-ATA-A-TA----CA-T-GT-TCAA-CCAT-TCCT
Alignment 2: CAC--ATAAAAAAGGTACAAAAGAAACATTGACAGGTTGCGTTGCCAGTATCAAGGA-AATATAGTTACAAAAGATTTTCCAACCACATGTGCCT
```
