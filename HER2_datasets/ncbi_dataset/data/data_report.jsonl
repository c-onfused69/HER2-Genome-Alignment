Involved in endoplasmic reticulum organization and glutaminyl-tRNAGln biosynthesis via transamidation. Located in mitochondrion. Part of glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase complex. Used to study cardiomyopathy. Human ortholog(s) of this gene implicated in combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 40. Orthologous to human QRSL1 (glutaminyl-tRNA amidotransferase subunit QRSL1).
